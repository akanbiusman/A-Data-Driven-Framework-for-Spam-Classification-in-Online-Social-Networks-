# A Data-Driven Spam Detection in Online Social Networks
This project presents a data-driven machine learning framework for spam detection across Online Social Networks (OSNs) such as X (Twitter), Facebook and Instagram. It integrates multiple datasets, advanced preprocessing, and diverse machine learning models to improve spam classification accuracy and robustness.

# Features

- Multi-source datasets (Twitter, SMS, Clickbait, Social Media Comments)
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization)
- Data balancing with SMOTE-ENN
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorization
- ML algorithms: Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN, etc
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, etc
- Data-driven system design for robust spam detection

# Datasets Used

- UTK Twitter Spam Detection Dataset
- Hugging Face Spam/Ham Comments Dataset
- Clickbait Dataset (Kaggle)
- UCI SMS Spam Collection Dataset

# Tech Stack
- Language: Python 3
- Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, etc
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
